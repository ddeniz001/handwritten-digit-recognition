# Handwritten Digit Recognition 
This is a basic Neural Network model that is able to learn what handwritten digits, and make predictions on what number the image is, based on a set of datas it parses through. 

## Requirements
* Python 3
* Tensorflow 2.0 +
You can simply run the program on your terminal, but jupyter notebook with tensorflow environment would be your best bet.
